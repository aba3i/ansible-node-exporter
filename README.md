# ansible-node-exporter
## For installation node exporter 


To use this script, you need to install Ansible in advance. I have put a script for you in this repo, which you can install using the following command:
```
cd ansible-node-exporter
bash ansibleinstall.sh
```
# set ansible hosts
## Hosts
To add hosts, proceed as follows:

```
[node-exporter]
"domain or host IP" ansible_ssh_port="portnumber" ansible_ssh_user="username" ansible_ssh_pass="password"
```
you can add many ip or domain like this command and save name file "hosts"

# Install node on dest hosts
## command 
To install on all nodes, you need to enter the following command and be sure to note that in your yml file, in the host section, you must enter the name that you put the hostsnames carefully, inside the yml file in the section "- hosts: "name set in hosts file"

```
vim / nano node-install.yml
change first line : - hosts: "name set in hosts file"
```
```
ansible-playbook -i hosts(hostfile name) node-install.yml
```
Note that you can download the desired version of node exporter from the link below and change it in the script "node.sh"
